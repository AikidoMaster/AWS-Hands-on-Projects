# AWS Deployment Pipeline Overview

---

üöÄ Welcome to the AWS CI-CD project! In this guide, we'll show you how to effortlessly automate your code's journey from source to deployment using AWS services. 

Our goal is to:

1. **Create a Deployment Target**  
   Set up servers to run your code effortlessly, with AWS Elastic Beanstalk managing everything for you.

2. **Build the Pipeline**  
   Connect your source code (from GitHub or other sources) to your deployment target using AWS Code Pipeline.

3. **Test the Pipeline**  
   Validate the pipeline by making changes to your code and witnessing automatic updates.
