# AWS CI/CD Project!

In this guide, you'll learn how to effortlessly automate your code's journey from source to deployment using AWS services.

## Project Goals

- **Create a Deployment Target:** Set up servers to run your code effortlessly, with AWS Elastic Beanstalk managing everything for you.
- **Build the Pipeline:** Connect your source code (from GitHub or other sources) to your deployment target using AWS CodePipeline.
- **Test the Pipeline:** Validate the pipeline by making changes to your code and witnessing automatic updates.

## Why Automation Matters

In today's fast-paced development environment, automation is your secret weapon. It ensures consistency, reduces errors, and speeds up the delivery of your applications. AWS provides a powerful suite of tools to help you achieve this, and this guide will explore them.

## Setting Up Your Deployment Target

Creating a robust foundation for your code deployment is crucial. This project will walk you through setting up your AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment. It's a hassle-free way to run your applications, as AWS takes care of server management and scaling.

## Building the Deployment Pipeline

Next, we'll dive into the heart of automation: building a deployment pipeline with AWS CodePipeline. This allows you to establish a smooth and efficient workflow where changes to your source code trigger automatic builds, tests, and deployments.

## Testing the Waters

Automation can seem daunting until you witness its magic. In the final part of this guide, we'll test the deployment pipeline by making code changes and watching the pipeline spring into action. It's a satisfying experience to see your application update effortlessly.
